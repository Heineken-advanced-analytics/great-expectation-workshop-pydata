# Great Expectations Workshop: Keep the Data Flowing
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Great Expectations workshop!

## Intro
We use the python package [great_expecations](#https://greatexpectations.io) to create expectations for our ingress data. This workshop teaches you the basics on how to implement and use this package.

## Installation

### Simple
```
$ python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Virtualenv
```
$ python3 -m venv great-expectations-workshop
```

*Windows:*  
```
$ great-expectations-workshop\Scripts\activate.bat
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m ipykernel install --name great-expectations-workshop
```
*MacOS/Unix:*  
```
$ source great-expectations-workshop/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m ipykernel install --name great-expectations-workshop
```
### Conda
```
$ conda create -n great-expectations-workshop pip -y
$ conda activate great-expectations-workshop
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m ipykernel install --name great-expectations-workshop
```


## Instructions for part 1
### Opening the notebook.
```
$ cd <repository directory>
$ jupyter notebook
```
open `workshop-pydata-part1.ipynb`

if you are working with a virtual environment, change your kernel to `great-expectations-workshop`


## Instructions for part 2
### Opening the notebook.
```
$ cd <repository directory>
$ jupyter notebook
```
open `workshop-pydata-part2.ipynb`

in another terminal run `great_expectations suite edit demo_suite`

### Initializing new Great Expectations project through the CLI

```
$ great_expectations init  
First, Great Expectations will create a new directory:  
    OK to proceed? [Y/n]: Y  
  
Would you like to configure a Datasource? [Y/n]: Y  
  
What data would you like Great Expectations to connect to?
  1. Files on a filesystem
  
What are you processing your files with?  
  1. Pandas
  
Enter the path (relative or absolute) of the root directory where the data files are stored.
  ./data
  
Give your new Datasource a short name.
  [data__dir]: weather_data

Great Expectations will now add a new Datasource 'weather_data' to your deployment,  
by adding this entry to your great_expectations.yml:
  Would you like to proceed? [Y/n]: Y
```


## Dataset

The original dataset can be found through [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region). The dataset used here is an adapted version of the original version from Kaggle (reduced and simplified, hopefully).

#### Columns
- Id - id associated with a particular weather station
- Elevation - self explanatory
- Lat - Latitude
- Lon - Longitude
- Code - Station number
- City - City associated with the station
- Timestamp - time when the record was made
- Precip - hourly amount of precipitation in milimiters
- Air_pres - air pressure in hPa
- Solar_rad - kJ / m2 solar radiation
- Temp - temperature during the past hour
- Rel_humidity - relative humidity (percentage)
- Wind_speed - speed of wind in meters per second

Would you like to profile new Expectations for a single data asset within your new Datasource? [Y/n]: n
